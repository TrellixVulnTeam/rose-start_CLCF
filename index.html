                    <p> In conversations revolving around computer science, math and robotics, our opinions and ideas are often overlooked. When that happens, we tend to think that our ideas are not good enough to be heard. 
                        Most women and non-binary experience some sort of gender exclusion from the field of technology. As young women in tech ourselves, our experiences led us to take action to help each other and those who have to work twice as hard as men in tech. 
                    </p>
                    <p>There is a misconception that suggests men are smarter than women and non-binary people. To this day, we still struggle to be part of the field of technology due to the lack of resources provided to us. When we arenâ€™t fully  granted  the opportunity to explore our interests and capabilities, society then defines technology as a field directly and exclusively for men.

                    <p>
                        With the goal of breaking the stigma that puts down women and non-binary in tech, we wanted to create a platform where women and 
                    non-binary can explore ways in which they can improve their skills and start building their career. This website is dedicated to making it easier for those who experience exclusion in tech to plan out their careers in these areas. </a>
